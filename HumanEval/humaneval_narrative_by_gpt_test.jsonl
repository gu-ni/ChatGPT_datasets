{"question_title": "has_close_elements", "question_content": "In the tranquil land of Numeria, a council of sages oversees a collection of mystical stones, each imbued with a unique power level. These power levels, known to the sages as floating-point strengths, are not arbitrary but are carefully recorded, as the harmony of Numeria depends on the careful arrangement of these stones. The number of stones in any gathering is not fixed, but the sages are adept at handling gatherings containing as many as N stones, where N may reach up to 10^5 in the largest of ceremonies.\n\nThe sages abide by an ancient law: for the energies of Numeria to remain balanced, no two stones may possess strengths that are too closely matched. This law is enforced by a sacred boundary, the threshold, a number handed down by the council for each gathering. If the difference in power between any two stones is less than this threshold, the stones are said to resonate dangerously, threatening the peace of Numeria.\n\nEvery stone’s strength is determined before the ceremony and remains unchanged throughout. The council’s task is to examine the list of strengths and the chosen threshold for that gathering. Their objective is to determine whether there exists at least one pair of stones whose strengths are so close that their difference falls below the sacred boundary. If even a single such pair exists, the sages must sound the alarm, for Numeria’s harmony is at risk; if not, the gathering may proceed undisturbed.\n\nThe council’s challenge, therefore, is as follows: For each gathering, they are presented with a parchment listing the strengths of all stones in attendance, followed by the value of the sacred threshold. The council must proclaim either “True” if Numeria’s harmony is threatened by a dangerously close pair, or “False” if all pairs are safely distanced. Their proclamation must be swift and reliable, regardless of how many stones are present.\n\nFor the council's records, an example is as follows: When presented with stones of strengths 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, and a threshold of 0.5, the sages find that no two stones are close enough to cause concern, so they declare “False.” In another gathering, with stones at 1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 2.0, and a threshold of 0.3, the council discovers that the stones with strengths 2.8 and 3.0 are dangerously close—closer than the threshold allows. Thus, the sages must declare “True,” for Numeria’s balance is in jeopardy.", "platform": "HumanEval", "question_id": "HumanEval/0", "contest_id": "HumanEval/0", "contest_date": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "starter_code": "class Solution:\n    def has_close_elements(self, numbers: List[float], threshold: float)-> bool:\n        ", "difficulty": "easy", "public_test_cases": "[{\"input\": \"[[1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.3]\", \"output\": \"true\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], 0.05]\", \"output\": \"false\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.95]\", \"output\": \"true\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.0, 2.0, 5.9, 4.0, 5.0], 0.8]\", \"output\": \"false\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.1]\", \"output\": \"true\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 1.0]\", \"output\": \"true\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"[[1.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1], 0.5]\", \"output\": \"false\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}]", "private_test_cases": "", "metadata": "{\"func_name\": \"has_close_elements\"}"}
{"question_title": "separate_paren_groups", "question_content": "In the ancient city of Parenith, the citizens practiced a unique art of communication using ribbons, each adorned with a series of intricate knots and loops. These ribbons, when viewed from end to end, formed a pattern of open and closed circles—some simple and others woven with layers, but always crafted with care so that every opening had its matching closure. The council of Parenith decreed a fundamental law: every complete pattern must begin with an open loop, conclude with a closed one, and the loops must be perfectly balanced, never leaving an opening without a closure. Moreover, while certain patterns could be nested within others, the council was particularly interested in those patterns that stood side by side, not entangled within one another.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of their traditions, the council established clear societal rules. Each ribbon presented for record-keeping must be a continuous sequence where every open circle is matched by its corresponding closure, with no stray or mismatched loops. Furthermore, while it was permissible for patterns to be complex and nested, the council sought to separate each distinct, non-overlapping group—those that were not nested within another, but rather stood as their own complete entity—from any ribbon brought before them. Any spaces or gaps found between the loops were to be disregarded, as the meaning lay solely in the circles themselves.\n\nOne day, a group of scribes was tasked with examining a long ceremonial ribbon presented by a visitor. The ribbon, as tradition demanded, was made up only of open and closed circles, sometimes spaced apart, sometimes directly adjacent. The scribes were to determine, for any given ribbon, how to divide it into its largest possible, perfectly balanced, and non-nested groups—each group to be recorded as a separate entry in the city’s grand ledger. The council insisted that the scribes be thorough and precise, ensuring that no group was missed and that each was as expansive as the rules allowed.\n\nThus, the task for the scribes was clear: whenever a ribbon was brought before them, they must ignore any empty spaces and focus solely on the sequence of loops. As they examined the ribbon from start to finish, they would carefully track the balance of openings and closures; each time they completed a perfectly matched group—one that was not enclosed within another—they would cut it free and set it aside before continuing. Their goal was to separate the ribbon into all such maximal, balanced, non-nested groups, preserving the order in which they appeared.\n\nFor the scribes, the process began with the presentation of the ribbon. The visitor would lay out the ribbon and recite its sequence, which the scribes would transcribe exactly as given, with open and closed circles (represented by the symbols '(' and ')'), possibly separated by spaces. The scribes’ answer would be a list of the extracted groups, each itself a string of circles, in the order they were found. \n\nFor example, when a visitor brought forth the ribbon inscribed as “( ) (( )) (( )( ))”, the scribes would disregard all spaces and observe the following: the first group was a simple pair of circles, the second was two circles nestled within one another, and the third was a more complex group with one pair nested within another. The scribes would therefore record the entries as ['()', '(())', '(()())'], each representing a distinct, non-nested, fully matched group from the ribbon, thus fulfilling their ceremonial duty in Parenith.", "platform": "HumanEval", "question_id": "HumanEval/1", "contest_id": "HumanEval/1", "contest_date": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "starter_code": "class Solution:\n    def separate_paren_groups(self, paren_string: str)-> List[str]:\n        ", "difficulty": "easy", "public_test_cases": "[{\"input\": \"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())\", \"output\": \"[\\\"(()())\\\", \\\"((()))\\\", \\\"()\\\", \\\"((())()())\\\"]\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"() (()) ((())) (((())))\", \"output\": \"[\\\"()\\\", \\\"(())\\\", \\\"((()))\\\", \\\"(((())))\\\"]\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"(()(())((())))\", \"output\": \"[\\\"(()(())((())))\\\"]\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}, {\"input\": \"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\", \"output\": \"[\\\"()\\\", \\\"(())\\\", \\\"(()())\\\"]\", \"testtype\": \"functional\"}]", "private_test_cases": "", "metadata": "{\"func_name\": \"separate_paren_groups\"}"}
